    "Collaboration between artists is something that has become very popular in recent years. Whether that is composing the music, writing the songs, or artists performing collaboratively we see many instances of this in today’s music industry. Collaboration between artists often opens their music to wider audiences, serving as a way to increase an artist's exposure while also creating new and unique approaches to music. For example, recent successful collaborations include “Die for you” by The Weekend featuring Ariana Grande combining R&B and pop artists. With the increasing popularity and success of artists' collaboration we aim to understand more deeply what factors influence collaboration and what is their predictability.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Other similar research regarding the correlation between releasing collaborative songs and the artists growth in popularity. Which found there to be a positive effect on an artist's popularity following the release of songs featuring other artists. Furthermore, analysis is done comparing economic and social capitals among other things, concluding that more successful collaborations occur between artists somewhat diverse from one another <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Other research perhaps helpful to ours includes Graph Attention Network modeling which is intended to be used to predict potential successful artist collaborations by weighing different features such as genre and artist popularity.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Learning and building on previous research we can analyse biographical and artistic data to identify the predicting factors of musical artists collaborating.\r\n",

    "We predict that artist genre and artist popularity will be the strongest predictors of whether or not a set of music artists would collaborate. We think that a music artist's genre and popularity together say a lot about the particular audience of that artist, and for the sake of success it's in the artists' best interests to make their collaborative work appealing to each of their fanbases. For example, it's common to see two famous rappers collaborate on a song, but it would be surprising to see a pop star work with an underground indie band."

    "The ideal dataset would integrate comprehensive artist data, track-level metadata, and collaboration details, and other factors that may affect the song, along with commercial performance metrics. Ideally, the dataset would encompass tens of thousands of artists and hundreds of thousands of tracks spanning multiple decades, ensuring a diverse and robust set of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ideal dataset in mind, I found three datasets that meet the criteria. First one is the [Spotify Artist Feature Collaboration Netork](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jfreyberg/spotify-artist-feature-collaboration-network?select=nodes.csv) from Kaggle by jfreyberg. It provides a structured representation of artist collaborations with nodes denoting individual artists and edges indicating the collaborative links between them. The second dataset, the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset) from Huggingface by maharshipandya, offers detailed track-level metadata—including audio features, release dates, and genres—which will enrich our analysis by contextualizing the musical and stylistic attributes of each collaboration. The third dataset, the [Spotify Charts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts) dataset from Kaggle by dhruvildave, contains performance metrics such as rankings and play counts over time, allowing us to evaluate the commercial impact of collaborations and correlate these trends with network features."

    "Data privacy will not be a major concern for this project since we will be analyzing music artists, who are all more or less famous celebrities in the public eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential form of bias in our data sets would be a lack of representation of artists who are up-and-coming or otherwise not as popular as others. Naturally, more popular artists have likely 1) had more time to participate in more collaborations, and 2) have a greater network of connections in the industry which further facilitates collaborations. Perhaps it would be possible to isolate and normalize against artist popularity when drawing conclusions, or else it may be necessary to accept that the conclusions apply more to the most famous artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest ethical concern for this project would be the potential reinforcement of harmful cultural stereotypes. Given that part of the research question seeks to understand how social identity factors impact music collaborations, it is possible that the conclusions of the analysis could implicitly outline issues of segregation and/or discrimination in general. It will be important throughout the project to not translate superficial data associations into dangerous cultural attitudes like an \"us vs. them\" mentality, and whenever these associations appear we should instead seek constructive explanations informed by history and social studies."
