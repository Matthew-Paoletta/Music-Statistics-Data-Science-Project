    "Collaboration between artists is something that has become very popular in recent years. Whether that is composing the music, writing the songs, or artists performing collaboratively we see many instances of this in today’s music industry. Collaboration between artists often opens their music to wider audiences, serving as a way to increase an artist's exposure while also creating new and unique approaches to music. The effects of collaboration are often analyzed, however, here we hope to explore the features that lead to collaboration in the first place. Understanding these features will give us insight into what factors influence collaboration and what is their predictability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors that might contribute to the any given collaboration, including artist information and demographical characteristics. These might include artists popularity and genre. For instance we often see frequent collaborations among the same genres, as we see in genres like Hip-Hop, where artist frequently make use of featured collaborations. Furthermore, other potential leading features of collaboration to consider would be demographic information, such as, gender, race, nationality, and age. For example, we can consider how similarities in geogrpahical region might lead for artist collaboration because of accessibility. Analyzing these factors across artistic information and demographics will assist us in identifying reliable predictors of artists collaboration.\n",

    "Other similar research regarding the correlation between releasing collaborative songs and the artists growth in popularity. Which found there to be a positive effect on an artist's popularity following the release of songs featuring other artists. Furthermore, analysis is done comparing economic and social capitals among other things, concluding that more successful collaborations occur between artists somewhat diverse from one another <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Other research perhaps helpful to ours includes Graph Attention Network modeling which is intended to be used to predict potential successful artist collaborations by weighing different features such as genre and artist popularity.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Learning and building on previous research we can analyse demographic and artistic data to identify the predicting factors of musical artists collaborating.\n",

    "We predict that artist genre and artist popularity will be the strongest predictors of whether or not a set of music artists would collaborate. We think that a music artist's genre and popularity together say a lot about the particular audience of that artist, and for the sake of success it's in the artists' best interests to make their collaborative work appealing to each of their fanbases. For example, it's common to see two famous rappers collaborate on a song, but it would be surprising to see a pop star work with an underground indie band."

    "## 1. Spotify Tracks Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Name:** Spotify Tracks Dataset  \n",
    "- **Link to the dataset:** [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset)  \n",
    "- **Observations:** 114,000  \n",
    "- **Variables:** 21\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Definitions and Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Popularity:**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** A score from 0 to 100 reflecting a track’s commercial performance.  \n",
    "  - **Clarification:** While the dataset provides this popularity metric, it does not detail the underlying methodology (e.g., whether it is based on streaming counts, user engagement, or other factors). Further documentation—potentially from Spotify’s API resources—may be needed to fully understand its derivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artists:**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Lists the performer(s) on each track.  \n",
    "  - **Relevance:** This field is crucial for detecting collaborations. By parsing the string (or list) of artists, we can identify tracks with multiple performers and thereby construct an artist-to-artist collaboration network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Album & Track Names:**  \n",
    "  - Serve primarily as contextual information for validation and matching across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio Features (e.g., danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, time_signature):**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** Continuous variables capturing various aspects of a track’s musical characteristics.  \n",
    "  - **Relevance:** When aggregated per artist, these variables form a comprehensive artistic signature, allowing us to assess whether similarities in musical style are linked to collaborative tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Variables (e.g., duration_ms, explicit, track_genre):**  \n",
    "  - Provide additional context—such as track length, content rating, and genre categorization—that can help refine the artist profiles.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Specific Columns and Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the detailed column-by-column documentation for this dataset is less extensive than for the Spotify Tracks dataset, the available information suggests it includes key metrics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Artist Identifier/Name:**  \n",
    "  - Uniquely identifies each artist.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Popularity Score:**  \n",
    "  - A measure of the artist’s overall market reach and listenership.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Additional Market Metrics:**  \n",
    "  - Likely includes variables such as follower counts, monthly listeners, or other performance indicators.  \n",
    "  - **Relevance:** These variables serve as a direct measure of an artist’s commercial performance, providing a quantitative baseline to compare with the aggregated artistic attributes from the Spotify Tracks dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a comprehensive analysis, these columns will be cross-referenced with the artistic features to understand how market performance correlates with creative output and collaboration.\n",

    "- **Dataset Name:** Artist Demographic  \n",
    "- **Location:** Located under the data folder (detailed in *mistral.py*)  \n",
    "- **Source:** Obtained from Mistral AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content and Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information Provided:**  \n",
    "  - Contains demographic details such as artist age, gender, and potentially nationality or race.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Role in Analysis:**  \n",
    "  - These demographic variables are key to addressing the research question by allowing us to compare the influence of demographic versus artistic factors on collaborative behavior.\n",
    "  - **Clarification:** While the Spotify and popularity datasets focus on artistic and market performance metrics, the demographic dataset fills the gap by providing personal background information that may also predict collaboration trends.\n",

    "  - **Parsing the 'artists' Column:**  \n",
    "    - Tracks where the 'artists' field contains multiple names will be flagged as collaborations.\n",
    "  - **Data Frame Structure:**  \n",
    "    - A dedicated collaboration data frame will be constructed with the following key components:\n",
    "      - **Track ID:** Unique identifier from the Spotify Tracks dataset.\n",
    "      - **Collaborating Artists:** A parsed list or pairwise breakdown of the artists involved.\n",
    "      - **Aggregated Features:** Derived metrics (e.g., average popularity, mean audio feature scores) for the involved artists.\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - **Purpose:**  \n",
    "    - This structure will serve as the basis for building an artist-to-artist network, facilitating further analyses on how artistic similarity and demographic factors relate to the frequency and nature of collaborations.\n",

    "     - Incorporate market performance metrics to complement the artistic profiles.\n",
    "   - **From Artist Demographics:**  \n",
    "     - Merge demographic data (e.g., age, gender) into the artist profiles to enable a comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modeling Collaborations:**  \n",
    "   - **Similarity Metrics:**  \n",
    "     - Compute similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity) between artist profiles.\n",
    "   - **Predictive Modeling:**  \n",

    "Although the music artists we will be analyzing are all more or less famous celebrities in the public eye, there are still concerns surrounding data privacy that we must consider for this project. In particular, it is possible that there is publicly available information about an artist which that artist does not want to be available. For this reason, it is important to check whether artists have consented for the data we are using to be released to the public, and if not we should avoid using that data. Fortunately, the artist information we are interested in, both artistic and demographic, originates from whatever information the artsists have released to the public themselves, such as their name, their songs, the language of their music if applicable, and their country of origin if they have specified it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential form of bias in our data sets would be a lack of representation of artists who are up-and-coming or otherwise not as popular as others. Naturally, more popular artists have likely 1) had more time to participate in more collaborations, and 2) have a greater network of connections in the industry which further facilitates collaborations. Perhaps it would be possible to isolate and normalize against artist popularity when drawing conclusions, or else it may be necessary to accept that the conclusions apply more to the most famous artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest ethical concern for this project would be the potential reinforcement of harmful cultural stereotypes. Given that part of the research question seeks to understand how social identity factors impact music collaborations, it is possible that the conclusions of the analysis could implicitly outline issues of segregation and/or discrimination in general. It will be important throughout the project to not translate superficial data associations into dangerous cultural attitudes like an \"us vs. them\" mentality, and whenever these associations appear we should instead seek constructive explanations informed by history and social studies."
